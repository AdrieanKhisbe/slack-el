A Slack client for Emacs

#### NOTE: CURRENTLY NOT WORKING; INCOMPLETE (see below)

slack.el is a client for the Slack chat service (http://slack.com/).

It can be customized with the following command:

    (customize-group "slack")

`slack-token` must be set to your token found here: https://api.slack.com/

## REQUEST FOR HELP

**This client is incomplete and is currently in a non-working state.** I'm not a Lisp programmer, just a new fan of Emacs and someone who uses Slack all day at work. I would love to be able to use Slack from within Emacs!

In my search for a Slack client for Emacs, I came across [an incomplete script](http://nullman.net/tutorial/emacs-files/.emacs.d/local-modules/slack.el.html) by [Kyle W T Sherman](http://nullman.net/).

To encourage collaboration on this project and help create a Slack client for Emacs, I've created this GitHub repo. If you can help in the development of this project, please open Issues and submit Pull Requests! I intend to work on this as I start learning Elisp, but I hope that we can make it a collaborative effort.

If you've written your own working Slack client, please let me know so that I can link to it here!
